This week we are joined with special guests Jan Miksovsky and Rob Bearman from Component Kitchen to talk about their work on the Web Component Gold Standard. The Gold Standard is an open source project which outlines best practices for creating Web Components. The Gold Standard presents developers with a checklist they can use to ensure their Web Components are of exceptional high quality matching that of native elements. The episode goes into where the requirement for the Gold Standard came from and why it is such an invaluable resource for Web Component developers. This includes discussion on why code reuse on the web is so difficult and how Web Components and the Gold Standard can help. We also talk about the future of the Gold Standard and how the community can help make it even better.
